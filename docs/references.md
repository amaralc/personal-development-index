## Branches and parallel progress

The commit history in Image 2 shows parallel progress in different topics indexed in [README.md](../README.md). The image was taken using [this repository](https://github.com/amaralc/courses-and-bootcamps) as reference.

Use a standardized way of naming branches, using lower case and separating category and item title with a slash in the branch name.

Ex.: 

- `book/team-topologies`
- `workshop/ignite-lab-node-js`
- `course/nest-js-fundamentals`

Ex.:
